Safari development of [Steve Lambert][1]'s [Add-Art][2] plugin. 

This extension is *not* currently functional, but it's close. Take alook at the issues to see what's left.  The code is very similar to [Add-Art-chrome][3]. At some point it would be great to merge this project with [add-art-chrome][3]

We'd love for you to help with this.

Safari development of [Steve Lambert][1]'s [Add-Art][2] plugin. 

This extension is *not totally* functional, but it is replacing ads. Take a look at the issues to see what's left.  The code is very similar to [Add-Art-chrome][3]. At some point it would be great to merge this project with [add-art-chrome][3]

We'd love for you to help with this.

[Here's](http://www.cultofmac.com/47341/how-to-enable-manage-extensions-in-safari-5/) how you install the extension for testing and development.
